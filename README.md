# HnK_keyboard
Comfortable keyboard (RP2040 python firmware)

This project base on https://github.com/makerdiary/python-keyboard and https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware
Hardware inspired ![Dactyl]https://hackaday.io/project/171793-yet-another-dactyl-build and ![ErgoDox]https://hackaday.com/2020/06/02/inputs-of-interest-ergodox-post-mortem/

## So many good keyboards out there, but none meet all my needs.
###  My #kbd wish list
- first: have to be cheap
- convenient use
- mechanical switches
- split
- USB connection (no bluetooth, RF wireless or mind conn)
- firmware write in circuitpython
- LED or neopixel underglow
- elastic configuration
  - many layers
  - tap / hold actions
  - macros
- mouse emulation
  - keys
  - analog joystick
  - 3D mouse

Raspberry Pi Pico with RP2040 ARM base microcontroler looks perfect for this project.

Modecom Volcano Hammer RED is switches and keycaps source https://modecom.com/en/volcano-hammer/

3D print custom plate / case, hand wiring and soldering.
