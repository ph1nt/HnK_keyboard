M60 Keyboard
============


## Setup Python
M60 has installed Python by default. If not, follow the steps to install Python.

1.  Hold the `ON/OFF` button at the back and then connect the keyboard a computer. It will run its bootloader and act as a USB drive named `M60Keyboard`.
2.  Copy `circuitpython-5.3.0-for-m60-keyboard.uf2` to the drive. You will get a new USB drive named `CIRCUITPY` if anything is OK.
3.  Copy `keyboard.py` and `action_code.py` to the the `CIRCUITPY` drive, and download two CircuitPython libraries - [adafruit-ble](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE) & [adafruit-hid](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HID) and put them into the `lib` directory of the drive.

    ```
    CIRCUITPY
    ├───action_code.py
    ├───code.py
    ├───keyboard.py
    └───lib
        ├───adafruit_ble
        └───adafruit_hid
    ```
4.  Change `code.py` to:

    ```python
    # code.py

    from keyboard import main

    main()
    ```
